max outbound / inbound connections or fan-out/fan-in between nodes.
- e.g., 50 node cluster, but node X doesn't talk to all 49 other nodes.
- e.g., 10,000 node cluster, but node X doesn't talk to all 9999 other nodes.

shelf/rack/zone clumping - RI vs R matrices.

targetMap: want to reach this state on all nodes & partitions in the cluster.
currentMap: represents the combined view of currentNodeMap's from all nodes.
currentNodeMap: represents the current state of partitions on a single node in the cluster.

actor kinds:
- participant (reads work queue and updates currentState)
- spectator
- conductor

request to node X: for partition P on node X,
  atomic state change from state S0 to S1.

request between node X and node Y: for partition P, want node X to stream data to node Y,
  with an optional atomic state change ("transition"), where...
    1) node X optionally turns from state S0 into state S1,
    2) node Y optionally turns from state S2 into state S3,
    3) node Y optionally temporarily blocks requests of type R
      until succeess/failure of step 3,
    and state changes use OCC / CAS.

  to handle takeovers,
    when S0 == master, S1 == dead,
         S2 == slave, S3 == master.
  to handle replica,
    when S0 == master, S1 == master,
         S2 == dead, S3 == slave
         or,
         S2 == slave, S3 == slave
    including XDCR and KV-to-BackIndex.

To transition safely from dead to master, need to first become a slave.
To transition safely from master to dead, need to first become a slave.

partition state transitions:
          | n d s m
-------------------
- null    | \ d d d
- dead    | n \ s s
- slave   | d d \ m
- master  | d d d \

pending is a transient / ephemeral state, that helps a takeover of a
master by a slave; on power reboot, state devolves back to slave or
master.

partition running transitions:
          | online | s w r c
----------------------------
- stopped | n      | \ w w w
- warming | y      | c \ r c
- running | y      | c c \ c
- cooling | n      | s s r \

persistence & replication pausing are orthogonal concerns.

how about proxy/router
- should work
- if have 40,000 nodes, and 40,000 clients,
  then need levels of indirection, or proxy/router.
-- that's just a different map,
   with model of multiMaster, no slaves,
   and R == W == 1 <= N

how about failOvers
- should work
- this is just a slave-to-master state change,
    as long as there are no other masters,
    and

rolling upgrade
- maintenance mode
-- need to hold old maps
- swap rebalance
-- needs to be part of planNewRebalanceMap
- each process should detect when it's fed info that's the wrong
  version window

how about GC'ing dead partitions to null?

how about other replica-like things
- should work
- index
- backIndex
-- need to record the source of each partition
- XDCR
- incremental backup

how about range splitting/repartitioning?
- outside range planner & range executor
- actualizeNewMap needs to know about steps to...
