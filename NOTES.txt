400000 nodes
docker cloud ready
MTTR very, very fast

mgmt container
- jscion
- per node
-- watchdogs local processes
-- multiple nodes per machine are possible (different ports)
--- as either one jscion or multiple jscion's
-- node can be tagged with multiple tags
--- what if tags are contradictory?
---- need logging/error
---- need tag prioritization metadata
-- child process declares what it needs
--- cmd-line includes auth credentials to mgmt container
--- cmd-line includes url's to other services needed by child process
--- cmd-line includes ports where child process will provide its
    services
--- clean shutdown / hup protocol for when ports or things change

how to get the s/w onto the node
- is responsibility of mgmt container or outside processes (docker? git?)

rebalance
rolling upgrade
- maintenance mode
- swap rebalance
- each process should detect when it's fed info that's the wrong
  version window
